# Pareto Problem Set

A carefully curated collection of LeetCode problems that follow the Pareto principle - focusing on the 20% of problem patterns that help solve 80% of coding interview questions.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project aims to help developers prepare for technical interviews efficiently by:

- Organizing problems by common patterns and techniques
- Focusing on high-impact problem-solving strategies
- Providing a structured learning path from easy to medium difficulty
- Emphasizing problems frequently asked in top tech companies
